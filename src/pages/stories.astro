        <Typography variant="p" component="p">
          Whenever she was about 15 she went on a long journey to the crashing stream. 
          The stream rolled all day and night; 
          It crashed when it was dark and when it was light,
          whenever it was pouring down raining,
          when the rain was pitter-pattering silently on the grass,
          or when it was storming and lightning striked,
          whenever it was loud or quiet,
          whenever the summer sun was shining or the wind was blowing where noone moved...
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="p" component="p">
          Ruby wanted to know something more. She asked the stream, "Oh Stream, oh Stream! Do you need help?"
          The stream replied, "I have enough. I go and crash over sleeping rocks." So Ruby went on her way. 
          The stream said "Wait wait wait! I know, you can ask the rainforest." "Oh that's a good idea," replied Ruby.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="p" component="p">
          Ruby began to walk to the rainforest, in the opposite direction. She heard a "drip drop" sound as 
          the rain fell on the tips of the leaves and the summer sun shined as the rain poured down which made
          the plants grow and the leaves sprout. All the animals were having lots of fun; jumping and climbing; 
          growing and learning.

        <Typography variant="p" component="p">
          Ruby asked the rainforest, "Oh Rainforest, oh Rainforest, What do you need?"
